            <p>At Microverse, students learn through a very unique
                 approach — by pair programming and collaborating
                  with other students in real time, just as they would
                   with colleagues of a distributed team in a real
                    company.</p>
                    <p>This innovative approach not only provides students
                         with an accountability partner and large, global
                          network of support, but also helps them learn 
                          remote workflows and acquire the collaboration and 
                          communication skills necessary to join a global 
                          company.</p>
                          <p>Students learn multiple programming languages and
                             Computer Science fundamentals, through working on
                              real projects with other students around the world.</p>
                              <p>Once students are done with the curriculum, we help
                                 them improve their portfolio, resume and online presence,
                                  and get ready for job interviews. Then, we help them
                                   find and apply to competitive jobs worldwide and negotiate
                                    job offers.</p>

                <p>I grew up in Argentina, went to school in Europe,
                     built a business in San Francisco, taught in Africa,
                      and lived in Asia for a year. In my life's journey,
                       I’ve seen that talent is everywhere, but opportunity
                        is not.</p>
                        <p>Nowadays, the Internet makes it possible for anyone
                             to connect with global jobs regardless of where
                              they were born or live. However, paying for a great
                               education is incredibly difficult for most people.</p>
                               <p>I started Microverse to change that—to help people
                                 from all around the world learn software development
                                  at no upfront cost and to connect them with global
                                   jobs no matter their location, gender, or
                                    background.</p>

                                <p>When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
                                    If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" 
                                    to execute the code after the invoking statement.Functions often compute 
                                    a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":  
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                    // Function is called, return value will end up in x
                                    function myFunction(a, b) {
                                      return a * b;            
                                      // Function returns the product of a and b
                                    }</code>

                                        <p>In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
                                            JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
                                            An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <code>let x;
                                        x = 6;</code>
                            <li> 
                                        <p>A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by
                                             a name, followed by parentheses (). Function names can contain letters,
                                              digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
                                              The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
                                              (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
                                              The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly 
                                              
                            brackets: {}
                                        </p>

                                    <code>function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
                                      }</code>
                            <li> 
                                        <p>JavaScript includes if-else conditional statements 
                                        to control the program flow, similar to other programming languages.
                                        se if conditional statement if you want to execute something 
                                        based on some condition.
                                        </p>

                                        {
                                            alert("1 is greater than 0");
                                        }</code>

                                        <p>JavaScript includes for loop like Java or C#. 
                                            Use for loop to execute code repeatedly. The for loop 
                                            requires following three parts: initializer, condition 
                                            and iteration:
                                        </p>
